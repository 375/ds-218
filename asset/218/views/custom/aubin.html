				<p>Chef Ashlee Aubin has been immersed in the Chicago culinary scene for over 10 years, starting with his first position at Home Bistro in Lakeview. Ashlee, a Michigan native, next joined the Zealous team, where he spent four years working his way up to sous chef before finding an opportunity to work for famed chef Grant Achatz at Alinea. Ashlee’s time at Alinea became his most formative culinary experience, and after a year at the restaurant as a chef de partie, he took the chance to move on and opened Wood restaurant in Lakeview. Wood earned wide acclaim and was honored to receive the Michelin Bib Gourmand award for three consecutive years from 2013 to 2015. Now the team from Wood has come together again to open Salero, a modern Spanish restaurant in the heart of the West Loop. Salero garnered immediate praise, including a glowing three-star review from Phil Vettel in the Chicago Tribune, for its subtle and refined take on Spanish flavors. Chicago Magazine has featured Ashlee as one of four chefs to know. And now Ashlee Aubin joins Mariano’s Tastemakers as he shares a few Spanish secrets for his savory paella full of smoky sausage and fresh seafood.</p>
